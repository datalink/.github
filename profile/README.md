# Datalink

We’re motivated by a desire to make the world better by helping the helpers. 

Emergencies, disasters and disruptions can be highly stressful for those with the job to protect, respond and recover from them. We’re using the power of mobile and internet to make this easier. 

We believe that better software will lead to better preparedness, better compliance, better execution under pressure and better outcomes, so we’re building the best app for governments, utilities and organisations around the world that deal with emergencies, risks and compliance, to enhance their operations from preparedness through to recovery.

## Engineering Culture

We’re a small, dedicated software engineering team headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. We balance elegance with pragmatism and sound judgement to punch above our weight and deliver great software that makes a difference.

We value:

- Working in a safe, positive and life-friendly workplace;
- Delivering meaningful results for our customers, the company and the planet;
- Being conscientious in our work, and pragmatic to maximise its value;
- Having integrity in our people and our systems.
- We like working with people who share our ethos for a healthy workplace.
